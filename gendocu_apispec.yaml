    authentication:
      text: This API does not require any authentication, but we have added a redundant auth method - Token Auth for demo purposes. You can select it and use it, but the results would be the same as without it.

    title: Token Auth
    description:
      text: The standard token authentication. This authentication method is only for demo purposes - the backend ignores the token in the current implementation.
    callAuthentication:
      token: # e.g. HTTP Header "Authorization: Bearer aaa.bbbbbbb.ccc"
        exampleValue: "aaa.bbbbbbb.ccc" # this value should be shared across all the schemes. It should have exactly the same scheme for each protocol - if it differs, then it should be separate authentication method
